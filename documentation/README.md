# What can we do with an NFT with RemixIDE?

- **Check NFT information:**  
  Retrieve details such as the metadata URL (`tokenURI`), ownership (`ownerOf`), and token balances (`balanceOf`).

- **Create (mint) or destroy (burn) an NFT:**  
  Mint a new NFT to assign it to a user, or burn an existing NFT to remove it from circulation.

- **Transfer an NFT:**  
  Send an NFT from one address to another using `transferFrom` or `safeTransferFrom`.

- **Approve someone else to transfer your NFT:**  
  Grant another address permission to transfer a specific NFT (`approve`) or all your NFTs (`setApprovalForAll`) on your behalf.
